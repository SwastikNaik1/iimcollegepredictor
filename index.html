            <h1>How to crack CAT Exam?</h1>
            <p>Cracking the CAT (Common Admission Test) requires a strategic and disciplined approach. Begin by understanding the exam pattern and syllabus thoroughly. Create a study plan that allocates ample time for each section: Quantitative Ability, Verbal Ability and Reading Comprehension, and Data Interpretation and Logical Reasoning. Focus on strengthening your basics through standard study materials and practice consistently with mock tests to improve speed and accuracy. Analyze your performance in these tests to identify and work on weak areas. Time management is crucial, so develop techniques to handle pressure and efficiently allocate time during the exam. Additionally, maintain a healthy lifestyle with balanced nutrition and adequate rest to ensure peak mental performance.</p>
